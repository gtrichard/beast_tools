edit_chain_length_xml.sh: Command Line script that takes as input a BEAST XML file to which you change the MCMC Chain length as well as the tree logs (so that 10 000 trees are generated).
spread3_rendering_fixer.sh : Command Line script that takes as input a SpreaD3 output renderer folder to fix the files so that SpreaD3 loads properly in recent versions of web browsers like Firefox.
